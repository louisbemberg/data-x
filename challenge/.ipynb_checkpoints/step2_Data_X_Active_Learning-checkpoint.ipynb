Im afraid of jumping in front of a train because what if I dont die right away and suffer until I die- and who knows how long that would take. Im afraid of jumping because im afraid of height in general and again, what if I dont die on impact. I cant shoot myself because I dont have a gun, but even then maybe Ill fuck it up and die from bleeding out or something instead dying the second the bullet hits me. I don't want to live, but I'm just too afraid to die   \n",
