       "5  Do you ever feel like this Today I saw my best friend and he talked about his summer: he said he started to smoke, drink alcohol and had sex for the first time. This really surprised me because my summer was very calm and not a lot happened. I feel disoriented and lost, almost like I’m falling behind and I’m not “growing up” like all the others and I don’t know what to do. Any advice.\\nP. S. Me and my friend are both 14.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",

Im afraid of jumping in front of a train because what if I dont die right away and suffer until I die- and who knows how long that would take. Im afraid of jumping because im afraid of height in general and again, what if I dont die on impact. I cant shoot myself because I dont have a gun, but even then maybe Ill fuck it up and die from bleeding out or something instead dying the second the bullet hits me. I don't want to live, but I'm just too afraid to die   \n",
